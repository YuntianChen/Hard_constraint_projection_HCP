Theory-guided hard constraint projection (HCP): a knowledge-based data-driven scientific machine learning method

Thank you for your interest in our work.
For more details, please refer to the paper [Theory-guided hard constraint projection (HCP)](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0021999121005192?token=05A1556D5AA2C1BE4661CE2AAF5CA97039CDA96F66A38B85C0162BA7C6BF99710D4FCEFF2E37F100CC14C0CA3A2B39FE&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20210825021436).

The detailed introduction video (in Chinese) about HCP can be found in the following link: https://jmq.h5.xeknow.com/s/4mS6b1

The code structure is shown in the [illustration](https://github.com/YuntianChen/Hard_constrant_projection_HCP/blob/main/Code_structure.JPG).

Researchers can modify the experiment setting through the configure.py file. This code can implement HCP, TgNN and conventional ANN respectively for comparative experiments.
