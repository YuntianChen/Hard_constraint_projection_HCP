# Hard_constrant_projection_HCP
Theory-guided hard constraint projection (HCP): a knowledge-based data-driven scientific machine learning method

Thank you for your interest in our work.
For more details, please refer to the paper [Theory-guided hard constraint projection (HCP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06148).
The code structure is shown in the [illustration](https://github.com/YuntianChen/Hard_constrant_projection_HCP/blob/main/Code_structure.JPG).

Researchers can modify the experiment setting through the configure.py file. This code can implement HCP, TgNN and conventional ANN respectively for comparative experiments.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
